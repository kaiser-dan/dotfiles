## :technologist: Contributing

Please follow these steps:

1. Give this project a star. :vulcan_salute:
2. Fork the project.
3. Clone the project to your own machine.
4. Create a branch. (`git checkout -b your-branch-name` or `gcb your-branch-name`).
    - Don't forget to change the **version.sh** file for creating the new version.
    - Don't forget to update the **CHANGELOG.md** file by adding some topics containing briefs of the changes you did. As you can see, there are plenty of entries there, so it's quite simple to create yours by following some example.
6. Commit changes to the branch you've just created.
7. Push your work back up to your fork. (`git push origin your-branch-name`).
8. Submit a Pull Request and take a coffee (or even better, you could take a coffee before it).
